The code appears to be syntactically correct, and assuming there are no typos or missing references, it should compile without errors or warnings. The code is very readable. It has clear naming conventions, and the purpose of each field and property is apparent. There doesn't seem to be any repetitive code, and there's no apparent dead code. No software defects, but the code doesn't include any exception handling or validation for the constructor parameters. Depending on the requirements of the application, it might be necessary to add validation to ensure that the input values are within acceptable ranges or formats. This authors code differed from mine in that they set a private string method for each individual pieace of information. I believe this was more efficient, especailly when it comes to the THREE largest cities, because finding the specifics of those three cities was something I struggled with in my project. My feedback would include: Think about implementing input validation in the constructor to ensure the integrity of the object's state.
