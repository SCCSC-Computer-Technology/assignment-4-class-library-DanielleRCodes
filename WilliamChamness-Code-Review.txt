There is no dead code, and the code is well-documented. Visual Studio doesn't report any compilation errors. There is nothing out of the ordinary as far as I can tell.

The class seems to be a wrapper for each state's info. It is difficult to tell how this class is used without looking at the code it is used in, but it seems that the data is simply stored once and read for processing later. In other words, the class is a just a collection of key/value pairs. I am not completely certain, but using a dictionary might be a more practical approach.
