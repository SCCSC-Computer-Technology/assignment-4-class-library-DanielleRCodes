Code review for Danielle:
Anna Stefanacci

Readability and Documentation:

- Your use of comments was great, very easy to read. I also liked how you organized it.

Repetitive Code and Dead Code:

- There was repetitiveness, which could have been avoided by using an object-oriented approach such as a class. 

Software Defects and Testing:

- As this is not a "runable" program. I was not able to fully test it, but I found no errors. 

Appropriateness of Framework and Code Usage:

- This program is what was asked of the assignment, and I liked how simple it was, other than the potential of using a class instead of the constructors. 

Constructive Feedback:

- I've been avoiding doing a code review for you, as you always do wonderful. Your code was significantly different than mine, so I liked seeing the way you did it.
